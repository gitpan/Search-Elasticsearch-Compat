NAME
    Search::Elasticsearch::Compat - A compatibility layer for migrating from
    ElasticSearch.pm

VERSION
    version 0.10

DESCRIPTION
    With the release of the official new Search::Elasticsearch module, the
    old ElasticSearch (note the change in case) module has been deprecated.
    This module, Search::Elasticsearch::Compat is a compatibility layer to
    help migrate existing code from the old module to the new.

    The client interface (ie "new()" plus all request methods like search())
    are completely compatible with the old ElasticSearch.pm. The "new()"
    method translates the parameters accepted by the old module to the
    parameters accepted by the new module. All tests in the old test suite
    pass.

    However, the networking layer has been replaced by the new
    Search::Elasticsearch module. The available transport backends are
    "http" (LWP via Search::Elasticsearch::Cxn::LWP), "httptiny" (HTTP::Tiny
    via Search::Elasticsearch::Cxn::HTTPTiny and "curl" (Net::Curl via
    Search::Elasticsearch::Cxn::NetCurl). The AnyEvent backends are not
    supported. That may change in the future.

    No further development of this compatibility layer is planned. It allows
    you to use your old code without change (other than the module name),
    but new code should use the new Search::Elasticsearch module.

    To use this module, you will need to change:

        use ElasticSearch;
        my $e = ElasticSearch->new(...);

    to

        use Search::Elasticsearch::Compat;
        my $e = Search::Elasticsearch::Compat->new(...);

    You can use the official client in the same code as the compatibility
    layer with:

        use Search::Elasticsearch;
        use Search::Elasticsearch::Compat;

        my $new_es = Search::Elasticsearch->new(...);
        my $old_es = Search::Elasticsearch::Compat->new(...);

Creating a new Search::Elasticsearch::Compat instance
  new()
        $es = Search::Elasticsearch::Compat->new(
                transport    =>  'http',
                servers      =>  '127.0.0.1:9200'                   # single server
                                  | ['es1.foo.com:9200',
                                     'es2.foo.com:9200'],           # multiple servers
                trace_calls  => 1 | '/path/to/log/file' | $fh
                timeout      => 30,

                no_refresh   => 0 | 1                               # don't retrieve the live
                                                                    # server list. Instead, use
                                                                    # just the servers specified
         );

    The "new()" method translates the parameters accepted by the old module
    into parameters accepted by the new Search::Elasticsearch module, and
    returns an Search::Elasticsearch::Client::Compat instance, which
    provides the same methods as were available in the old ElasticSearch
    module.

   servers
    "servers" can be either a single server or an ARRAY ref with a list of
    servers. If not specified, then it defaults to "localhost:9200".

    These servers are used in a round-robin fashion. If any server fails to
    connect, then the other servers in the list are tried, and if any
    succeeds, then a list of all servers/nodes currently known to the
    Elasticsearch cluster are retrieved and stored. This list of known nodes
    is refreshed automatically.

   no_refresh
    Retrieving the list of live nodes from the cluster may not be desirable
    behaviour if, for instance, you are connecting to remote servers which
    use internal IP addresses, or which don't allow remote "nodes()"
    requests.

    If you want to disable the sniffing behaviour, set "no_refresh" to 1, in
    which case the transport module will round robin through the "servers"
    list only. Failed nodes will be removed from the list (but added back in
    later if they respond to a ping or when all nodes have failed).

   Transport Backends
    There are three "transport" backends that Search::Elasticsearch::Compat
    can use: "http" (LWP via Search::Elasticsearch::Cxn::LWP), "httptiny"
    (HTTP::Tiny via Search::Elasticsearch::Cxn::HTTPTiny and "curl"
    (Net::Curl via Search::Elasticsearch::Cxn::NetCurl). The AnyEvent
    backends are not supported.

    The "httptiny" backend is faster than "http", but does not use
    persistent connections. If you want to use it, make sure that your open
    filehandles limit ("ulimit -l") is high, or your connections may hang
    because your system runs out of sockets. The "curl" backend is the
    fastest and uses persistent connections, but must be installed
    separately as it relies on "libcurl".

OTHER METHODS
    See Search::Elasticsearch::Client::Compat for documenation of methods
    supported by the client.

TEST SUITE
    The full test suite requires a live Elasticsearch cluster to run. CPAN
    testers doesn't support this. You can see full test results here:
    <http://travis-ci.org/#!/clintongormley/Search::Elasticsearch::Compat/bu
    ilds>.

    To run the full test suite locally, run it as:

        perl Makefile.PL
        ES_HOME=/path/to/elasticsearch make test
